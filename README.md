## Triton Base

The Triton core (also called Triton.Core) provides all the necessary functionalities for a complete application framework:

    * Data persistence.
    * Extensive modularity.
    * User management (authentication, fine grained control for data access, handling of concurrent access of resources).
    * Workflow and reporting engines.
    * Web services and internationalization.
 
Thus constituting a complete application platform which can be used for any relevant purpose.

## Modules and functional coverage
 
The official modules cover the following functional components: 
 
    * Financial Accounting.
    * Sales management.
    * Inventory and stock management.
    * Analytical accounting.
    * Customer Management.
    * Purchasing management.
    * Supply chain management.

    * Projects management.
    * Subscription management.
    * Third party integration.  
	
They establish a sane base and an easy to use abstraction of some of the key concepts for every business customisation.

## Technical characteristics 
  
The core provides the technical foundations needed for most business applications. However, it is not associated with any particular field of operation, thus constituting a general framework for application development:

    * Data persistence: guaranteed by mapping to persistent objects called **Models**, which allow creation, migration and easy access to records. 
    * User management: the kernel comes with base features for user management; user groups, access rules by models and records, etc. 
    * Workflow Engine: allows the activation of a workflow for any business model. 
    * Report Engine: The report engine is based on **reportbook**(https://web.archive.org/web/20110727150314/http://relatorio.openhex.org/) that uses ODT files as templates and generates ODT or PDF reports.
    * Internationalization: Triton is currently available in English, French, German, Spanish, Russian and Italian. New translations can be added directly through the client interface. 
    * Historical data: you can enable the history for any business model allowing for example to obtain the list of all past costs for any product. It also allows dynamic access to historical records at any time in the past: therefore the customer information on any open invoice will be that which is on the date on which the information is consulted. 
    * Support for DAV protocols: WebDAV, CalDAV and CardDAV. Which allows full document management and synchronization of calendars and contacts. 
    * Support for **XML-RPC** protocols.
    * There is independence from Database Management System and has support for SQLite. 
    * Integrated automatic migration mechanism: allows updating the database schema without human intervention. Migration from one series to the next is guaranteed (versions of the same series do not require migration). This automation is possible because the migration process is continuously taken into account and tested during development. 
	* Advanced modularity: modularity allows to provide a layered approach in business concepts along with great flexibility, which accelerates developments.

## What is an ERP system?

ERP is business management software that enables an organization to use a system of integrated applications to manage accounts and integrate a company's financial, supply chain, operations, reporting, manufacturing, and human resources activities.

Now that we know what an ERP system is, let's learn about the five steps we must follow to implement a better solution for your company.

### First Step: Identify the limitations of the current system

Here are the three signs that the time has come to replace the legacy system and implement new software:

    * growth stop
    Has the current system adapted to the growth of the company and the addition of more employees, customers and business processes, or to the addition of new lines of business or markets? An ERP solution must allow the company to expand while operating and maintaining its day-to-day business processes.

    * Lack of information
    Although ERP Software provides real-time information about the entire company, as well as the broader industry, many companies are still using legacy software that does not communicate with other systems. This can cause the isolation of the different departments. Having software that unites the different systems and provides data analysis and business information is a winning bet with which you can increase productivity, grow and be more competitive.
 
    * Expensive legacy system
    Most companies have taken a hard look at the implementation and maintenance fees they pay for their current ERP system. Even though they know the costs, most are unaware of the pros and cons associated with each deployment option, be it on-premises or in the cloud, or in a hosted ERP solution. It may be time for an even more comprehensive analysis to decide whether to transition to the cloud, keep the system on-premises, or opt for a hybrid solution.

### Second Step: Remember what an ERP system should offer

Let's start with the basics about ERP. Some of the basic components that a legacy ERP system should have are:

    * Financial management
    The system should not simply help you achieve regulatory compliance. It must also provide accurate data and analysis to help you control your budget, including managing multiple currencies, managing cash flow, and banking transactions.
 
    * Manufacturing
    This functionality should provide manufacturers with the ability to access data in real time to optimize production planning, as well as project and cost management. An ERP system for manufacturing must also offer the ability to manage resources and meet customer needs.
 
    * Supply chain
    Gone are the days of manually entering information and taking a physical inventory of merchandise. This functionality should improve warehouse and inventory management, and offer companies more information about their products and integrated logistics.

### Third step: Discover what Triton offers

Modern ERP systems like Triton offer built-in intelligence that helps users optimize results. They also grow with the company as they enter other markets and help protect company and customer data. In addition, a modern ERP platform meets customer needs even better by enabling less expensive customization. This means you can work with the legacy system and adapt when business processes grow. They also offer other resource planning tools, such as:

    * Productivity increase.
    * Control of financial management.
    * Help to improve customer service.
    * Help for human resource management.
    * Optimization of project management needs.
    * Improved supply chain management and operations.
    * Better decisions through business intelligence and AI.

A global ERP system also offers advantages. It streamlines all core finance and operations functions and helps you work with standard business processes, making it easy to expand into new markets and work across the globe. On a global scale, an ERP system has tools to:

    * Facilitate collaboration across the virtual organizatio n.
    * Operate in new locations that allow easy entry into new markets.
    * Standardize on a single ERP solution and help simplify the IT environment.
